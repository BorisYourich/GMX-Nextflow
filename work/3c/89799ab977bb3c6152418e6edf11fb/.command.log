Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

NOTE 1 [file /home/boris/GMX-Nextflow/RE/04/us.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy

NOTE 2 [file topol.top, line 876]:
  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure
  coupling, which can lead to instabilities. If you really want to combine
  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use Berendsen
  pressure coupling instead.

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.285 nm, buffer size 0.085 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.210 nm, buffer size 0.010 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
