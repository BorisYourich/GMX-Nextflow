Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.285 nm, buffer size 0.085 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.210 nm, buffer size 0.010 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 96x96x104, spacing 0.117 0.117 0.117

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.16

This run will generate roughly 636 Mb of data
