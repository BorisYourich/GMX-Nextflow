  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy

NOTE 2 [file topol.top, line 876]:
  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure
  coupling, which can lead to instabilities. If you really want to combine
  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use Berendsen
  pressure coupling instead.


The center of mass of the position restraint coord's is  5.648  5.754  7.611
