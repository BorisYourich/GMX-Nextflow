  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy

NOTE 2 [file topol.top, line 876]:
  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure
  coupling, which can lead to instabilities. If you really want to combine
  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use Berendsen
  pressure coupling instead.
